Scenarios 
=========

1. Joe is a communications major at UMass Lowell and he has been so busy that he forgot to register for courses and he needs to do it quickly before more people can register and he won't be able to get a spot! He doesn't need to worry though because thanks to the new inSPIRE he can quickly compare what courses he has taken, which ones he is now eligible to take and which ones he needs to take next. Being able to see all of these on one convenient page will save Joe time and help him get in class before those pesky freshman get a chance to register.
